# Deployment
When I started this project, I had to use Code Institutes template to be able to deploy it in Heroku and save all files that is secret in an gitignore file that came along the template. 
Then I used Gitpod IDE to bult this project and saved it with **git add**, **git commit** and then pushed it to github with the command **gitpush**. 
For saving code from django, I need to save it by the commands **python3 manage.py makemigrations** and then **python3 manage.py migrate** before I push the code to github and to finally deploy the project to Heroku. And the last step set the Debug to False in my app setting in django to get all the static files to show on the final deployment.

### Project deployment to Heroku
1. Log in to my account at Heroku
2. Select "new" and "Create new app" from the dashboard.
3. Create a unique name for the project
4. Navigate from the deploy tab at the top and select the setting tab.
5. Because I use Code Institute template, I need to add a config var for creating this app. (Not necessary if you do not use the template)
6. Select Reveal config vars button. In KEY field, input PORT with capital letters. In VALUE field, input 8000 and then select add button.
Select Python as yout first bulid pack in buildpacks window and save that.
9. Select the deploy tab again and go to the deployment method section.
10. Select GitHub - connect to GitHub button and follow the steps to connect to your GitHub account.
11. Select your account and enter the name of your repository and then select search.
12. When Heroku has find your repository select connect to connect the repository to the app within Heroku.
13. Below App connected section, I choose to manual deployments options further down.
14. When that is done correctly this will provide me the live link for this programe.
15. Then I choose Automatic Deploys button that will automatically rebuild the app everytime you add, commit and push from GitPod.
