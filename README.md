## Design Choises
### Fonts
I have two main fonts from Google Fonts. 
'Handlee' and 'Dancing script' that meet up my thoughts of how i want a first time user want to feel when they visit. Soft and friendly and kind of playful. Using this in the Logo and as rubric. And Handlee is using as rubrics and bread-text.
### Colours
The color is between #bdfd2d, 22c23c and chose this type of coloring because I want the app to be eye captured so bright colors are a fine match

## Wireframes
I have been following the structure from the wireframes, with some changes for message and the notifications that i chose to not go with on this project for the lack of time and knowledge for that.

## Bugs
During the development of this project, I got alot of bugs and errors. Some of them was easy to fix by just read what the error message that telling me what is wrong. Small errors like indent problems, forgot to import something from views, models or urls, spelling errors in the variables etc. Then I got bigger issues and errors that I had more problem to solve. some of them I solved after searching through the entire internet and found good answers in eg stackoverflow and similar forums. Some problems I had to get help from tutor support who has helped me solve some of the biggest bugs during the project.

Final bug (about styling django adminstration) emerged in the last minutes for submmutting. I renamed the url in cloudinay to match the one in the console error and hardrefreshed the page but did not go very, so me mentor suggested to add as a bug in Readme file.

# Deployment
When I started this project, I had to use Code Institutes template to be able to deploy it in Heroku and save all files that is secret in an gitignore file that came along the template. 
Then I used Gitpod IDE to bult this project and saved it with **git add**, **git commit** and then pushed it to github with the command **gitpush**. 
For saving code from django, I need to save it by the commands **python3 manage.py makemigrations** and then **python3 manage.py migrate** before I push the code to github and to finally deploy the project to Heroku. And the last step set the Debug to False in my app setting in django to get all the static files to show on the final deployment.

### Project deployment to Heroku
1. Log in to my account at Heroku
2. Select "new" and "Create new app" from the dashboard.
3. Create a unique name for the project
4. Navigate from the deploy tab at the top and select the setting tab.
5. Select Reveal config vars button. In KEY fields add CLOUDINARY_URL, DATABASE_URL, HEROKU_HOSTNAME, SECRET_KEY
6. Select Python as yout first bulid pack in buildpacks window and save that.
7. Due to a recent security breach, Heroku has suspended all continuous integration/deployment from Github.
   So now it needs to be done via the CLI
8. To login to Heroku with Multi-Factor Authentication enabled, I navigat to the account setting 
9. Scroll down to the API Key section, then click on the 'reveal' button, and copy the API Key
10. Then run the command in the terminal: heroku login -i
11. Type in email address
12. The  API Key should now paste into the Password field.
    Hit enter, and Heroku should log you in now.
13. After logging in, get the app name from heroku, command: heroku apps
    Set the heroku remote. 
    command: heroku git:remote -a shareit123
14. Add, commit and push to github
15. Push to both github and heroku
     command: git push origin main, command: git push heroku main
